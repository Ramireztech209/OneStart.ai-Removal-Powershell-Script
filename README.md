This PowerShell script is designed to help remove traces of OneStart.ai and DBar from your Windows system. It works by:

Stopping related processes: It identifies and terminates running programs associated with OneStart or DBar in known installation locations.
Removing files and folders: It deletes program files and data left behind in common user profile (AppData) and system-wide locations (like Program Files or ProgramData).
Cleaning registry entries: It removes specific registry keys and startup entries related to OneStart and DBar from both individual user profiles (HKEY_CURRENT_USER linked via HKEY_USERS) and the system-wide configuration (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE), including known uninstall records.
Deleting scheduled tasks: It finds and unregisters tasks set up by the software to run automatically.
The script includes checks for several known names and locations associated with OneStart and DBar and incorporates basic error handling to report items it couldn't remove.

How to Run the Script Properly:

Because this script modifies system-wide areas (like Program Files, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and Scheduled Tasks), it must be run with Administrator privileges. Running it without these privileges will prevent it from completing the removal effectively and may result in "Access Denied" errors.

The best way to run the script and see its progress and results is from an elevated PowerShell window:

Open PowerShell as Administrator:

Click the Start button.
Type PowerShell.
Right-click on "Windows PowerShell" or "PowerShell" in the search results.
Click "Run as administrator".
If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click "Yes" to allow it to run with elevated permissions.
Navigate to the script's location:

Once the PowerShell window is open, use the cd (Change Directory) command to go to the folder where you saved the .ps1 script file.
For example, if you saved it to your Desktop, you might type:
PowerShell

cd $env:USERPROFILE\Desktop
or replace $env:USERPROFILE\Desktop with the actual path (e.g., C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop).
Execute the script:

Type ./ followed by the name of your script file (e.g., ./YourRemovalScript.ps1).
Press Enter.
The script will now run, displaying messages in the PowerShell window as it proceeds through each removal step. The Press Enter to exit prompt at the end will keep the window open so you can review the output.
